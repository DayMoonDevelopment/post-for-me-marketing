              , we started seeing a flood of client requests for social media
              integrations. It seemed like with LLMs and AI coding tools, it was
              getting easier to build fast. And at the same time, platform
              algorithms were more rewarding to anyone who posted consistently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, there were real reasons to add social posting to all
              kinds of products: workflow tools that needed organic outreach,
              AI-powered content apps, or dashboards that helped manage multiple
              accounts. Developers were moving quickly, and their users wanted
              to share everywhere without friction.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem, though, were the integrations themselves. We kept
              running into the same headaches for every client: each platform
              handled media, auth, and updates in its own way. A simple feature
              could eat weeks of dev time, pulling focus away from what actually
              mattered to the product.

                After building the same integrations over and over, the patterns
                became obvious. Every platform did things a little differently:
                media processing, OAuth flows, webhooks versus polling. The
                little differences added up to a lot of overhead.
              </p>

                {`We ended up spending more time maintaining fragile
                infrastructure than building features. Existing tools weren't
                much help either. Most were built for end users first, with APIs
                tacked on later. That meant hidden limits, costs that spiked
                fast, and restrictions that forced awkward workarounds.`}
              </p>
              <p>
                {`So we took everything we'd learned and built a single API around
                the stuff that stays the same across platforms: connecting
                accounts, handling media, posting content, pulling analytics. We
                kept the common path dead simple.`}
              </p>
              <p>
                {`At the same time, we left the door open for platform-specific
                needs. Posting to Instagram stories instead of the feed? Pinning
                to a particular Pinterest board? It's just an extra parameter.
                No need to learn a whole new endpoint.`}
              </p>
              <p>
                We designed it the way we wanted tools to be designed: clean
                docs, predictable behavior, no surprise caps. Integrate once and
                post anywhere, then get back to building the parts of your
                product that actually matter.
