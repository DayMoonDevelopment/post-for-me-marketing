# Post for Me - Copywriting Style Guide

## Voice & Tone

**Developer-First**: Technical precision, explain benefits plainly, respect time with scannable content
**Direct**: Benefits before features, no marketing fluff, back up claims
**Professional but Approachable**: Credible without being stuffy, human not salesy
**Transparent**: Honest about capabilities, clear pricing/limits, address concerns directly

**Avoid**: Superlatives (revolutionary/amazing), vague promises (boost productivity), artificial urgency (limited time), marketing speak (leverage/synergy/ecosystem), unnecessary emojis/exclamation points

## Writing Principles

1. **Time Savings** - "hours, not weeks", "minutes, not months", "Get live same day". NOT "Save time with amazing platform"

2. **Simplicity & Unity** - "9 platforms. 1 tool.", "single API", show what you're replacing ("dozens of APIs"). NOT "Only API you'll ever need"

3. **Benefits First** - Structure: Feature → Benefit → Impact. Start with user gains, explain how feature enables it. NOT feature lists without context

4. **Specific Numbers** - "9 platforms", "$10/month for 1,000 posts", "24-hour response". NOT "Multiple platforms", "Affordable pricing"

5. **Address Pain Points** - Acknowledge problem (OAuth complexity, maintenance, quirks), present solution specifically. NOT "Make your life easier"

6. **White Label** - "Your users. Your brand.", "Bring your own credentials", position as invisible infrastructure. NOT "Powered by Post for Me"

## Structural Guidelines

**Headlines**: 6-12 words, benefit-driven, start with verb/benefit, specific numbers. ✅ "Ship integrations in hours, not weeks" ❌ "Welcome to Post for Me"

**Subheadlines**: 10-25 words, expand on headline, complete sentences. ✅ "Quickly integrate social media platforms to power posting, feeds, metrics through a single API"

**Body Copy**: Short sentences (15-20 words), 2-4 sentence paragraphs, lists for multiple points, bold sparingly, em dashes not semicolons

**CTAs**:

- Primary: "Get Started", "View API Docs", "🚀 Start Coding Today"
- Secondary: "Learn More", "Get in Touch", "View Docs"
- Avoid: "Click here", "Submit"

**Feature Descriptions**: Benefit-focused title ("Ship in hours, not weeks" NOT "Fast Integration") + one sentence how + optional details

**FAQ**: Natural questions (What/How/Why/Can/Do), direct answer first sentence, context after, include links

## Pricing & Technical Writing

**Pricing**: Show exact prices, explain what's included/what happens at limits. Proactively address overage policy. ✅ "Won't shut down or auto-charge. Consistent overages = upgrade conversation" ❌ "Flexible pricing"

**Docs Links**: Clear descriptive text, full URLs in FAQs, link to specific sections. ✅ "[Getting Started guide](url)" ❌ "Click [here](link)"

**Technical Terms**: Proper capitalization (OAuth, REST API, SDK, webhook), explain on first use. ✅ "OAuth 2.0 authentication" ❌ "Oauth", "Rest Api"

**Platform Names**: TikTok, X, LinkedIn, YouTube, Bluesky, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Threads (note capitalization). List order: TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Bluesky, Threads, YouTube

## Content Types

**Homepage**: Hero (value prop + rotating use cases) → Platform logos → 6 key features → Integration (tech + code) → Use case accordion → FAQ → Open source. Tone: Broad, benefit-focused, action-oriented

**Developer Page**: Technical headline → Feature cards (REST/SDKs/Webhooks) → Code examples → Quick start paths → CTAs. Tone: Technical, specific, examples-focused

**Pricing**: "Predictable pricing without surprises" → Interactive tier selector → What's included → Overage policy → Enterprise option. Tone: Transparent, reassuring

**FAQ**: Organized by topic, natural questions, thorough answers with links. Tone: Helpful, direct

## Formatting & Brand

**Text**: Bold key feature words (sparingly), italics rare, descriptive links, parallel list structure

**Numbers**: Spell out 1-9 in prose, numerals 10+, always numerals in headlines. Prices: "$10", "$1,000", "/mo"

**Brand**: "Post for Me" (NOT PostForMe/PFM), "Day Moon Development", postforme@daymoon.dev

**Domains**: postforme.dev (marketing), app.postforme.dev (dashboard), api.postforme.dev (docs)

**GitHub**: DayMoonDevelopment org, post-for-me repo

## Review Checklist

Developer-first tone, benefit headlines, specific numbers, no hype, correct technical terms/platform names, descriptive links, clear CTAs, transparent pricing, addresses pain points, scannable copy

## Summary

Clear over clever. Specific over vague. Benefits over features. Developer-first over marketing-first. Transparent over salesy. Concise over comprehensive. Honest over hyperbolic.

**Test**: "Would a developer trust this?" If yes, ship it. If no, simplify.
