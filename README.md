**A single, unified API for social media posting, feeds, and analytics.**

Post For Me is a unified API for social media integrations. Instead of wrestling with TikTok's API, Facebook's Graph API, X's OAuth quirks, and 6 other platform-specific implementations, you integrate once with Post For Me.

## What You Can Build

- **Social Media Schedulers** - Ship with 9 platforms instead of spending months per integration
- **AI Content Tools** - Generate content and publish it everywhere with a single API call
- **Marketing Dashboards** - Pull analytics and manage posts across all platforms in one place
- **Mobile Games** - Let players share achievements to their favorite platforms
- **B2B SaaS** - Add social features without derailing your roadmap

## Why Developers Choose Post For Me

**Ship in hours, not weeks**
One API replaces dozens. Get your first post live the same day you start integrating.

**9 platforms, zero maintenance**
We track API changes, handle deprecations, and manage OAuth flows. You write code once.

**Your brand, not ours**
Bring your own OAuth credentials. Your users see your app name, not ours. True white-label support.

**Transparent pricing**
$10/month for 1,000 posts. $1,000/month for 200,000 posts. No per-seat fees, no account limits, no surprises.

**Open source**
Our codebase is public on GitHub. Self-host if you want, contribute if you'd like, or use our hosted version.
